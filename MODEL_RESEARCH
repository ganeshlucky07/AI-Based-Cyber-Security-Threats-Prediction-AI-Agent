AI Model Research for a Predictive Cybersecurity Platform

This document provides an in-depth overview of AI and Machine Learning models for predictive cybersecurity. The content covers malware detection, network intrusion, anomaly detection, and phishing/URL analysis, detailing mechanisms, data requirements, strengths, and weaknesses.

Malware Prediction

Objective: Classify files as malicious or benign based on static characteristics.

Model A: Ensemble Methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)

How it Works: Combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions based on file features. Required Data & Features: File metadata (size, entropy), DLLs, function calls, section names, string analysis. Strengths: High accuracy, explainable, fast to train. Weaknesses: Requires manual feature engineering, vulnerable to obfuscation.

Model B: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

How it Works: Converts file binaries into images for pattern recognition. Required Data & Features: Raw binary content. Strengths: Automatic feature extraction, resistant to obfuscation, detects novel threats. Weaknesses: Black-box model, computationally expensive.

Network Intrusion & Anomaly Prediction

Objective: Analyze network traffic to identify ongoing or impending attacks.

Model A: Unsupervised Autoencoders

How it Works: Trained on normal activity; high reconstruction error indicates anomalies. Required Data & Features: NetFlow, firewall logs, packet size, IPs, protocols, ports. Strengths: Detects zero-day attacks, does not require labeled attacks. Weaknesses: Dependent on clean baseline, alerts do not explain the issue.

Model B: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs)

How it Works: Learns sequences of network packets to detect deviations. Required Data & Features: Time-series network session data. Strengths: Context-aware, detects multi-stage attacks. Weaknesses: Complex, computationally intensive.

Phishing & Malicious URL Prediction

Objective: Analyze emails and URLs for phishing detection.

Model A: NLP with Transformers (BERT)

How it Works: Fine-tuned BERT identifies linguistic cues in phishing content. Required Data & Features: Email text, headers, subjects, URLs. Strengths: Deep contextual understanding, state-of-the-art accuracy. Weaknesses: Resource-intensive, slower than simpler models.

Model B: Gradient Boosting (URL Features)

How it Works: XGBoost on lexical and host-based URL features. Required Data & Features: URL length, dots, keywords, HTTPS, domain age. Strengths: Fast, lightweight, effective for obvious phishing URLs. Weaknesses: Can be bypassed by obfuscation or legitimate-looking domains.

Recommended Development Plan

Strategy: Multi-layered defense combining fast triage and deep analysis.

Phase 1: Real-Time Triage and Baseline Detection (MVP)

Malware & URL Screening: Ensemble Models for rapid classification. Network Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised Autoencoder establishes baseline and flags anomalies.

Phase 2: Deep Analysis and Threat Confirmation

Advanced Malware Analysis: CNN for deep binary inspection of flagged files. Advanced Phishing Detection: BERT for analyzing flagged emails/URLs for nuanced phishing patterns.

This two-phase approach ensures rapid initial detection with Phase 1 and deep, high-confidence confirmation with Phase 2. bold text
